### Building from source
1. Get the latest release from GitHub by cloning the repo:  
    `$ git clone https://github.com/ksnip/kColorPicker`
2. Change to repo directory:  
    `$ cd kColorPicker`  
3. Make new build directory and enter it:  
    `$ mkdir build && cd build`  
4. Create the makefile and build the project:  
    `$ cmake .. && make`  
5. Install shared library (not required when only using the example):  
    `$ sudo make install`  
6. Run the example application:  
    `$ ./example/kColorPicker-example`  


### Shared vs Static
You can either build the project as shared library by providing the flag `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
to cmake or `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` to build as static library. On Windows we currently can
only build as static library.


### Integrate library in project

1. Let cmake find the shared library, optionally with version  
    `set(KCOLORPICKER_MIN_VERSION "0.x.x")`  
    `find_package(kColorPicker ${KCOLORPICKER_MIN_VERSION} REQUIRED)`  

2. Link the library with your application  
    `target_link_libraries(myApp kColorPicker)`
